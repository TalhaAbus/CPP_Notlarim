# Some Definitions in C++ Language

### Undefined Behaviour
- It may be correct according to the language rules, but there is no guarantee about what the situation will be like when compiled and run.
### Unspecfied Behaviour
- A behaviour that is not specified in the standards, or even if specified, can result in more than one outcome. The compiler can generate code in any way.
### Implementation Defined
- This is also unspecified behaviour, but the compiler is required to document it. A behaviour is defined, but this definition is left to the compiler. The compiler must document it and is required to consistently choose a certain option in generating code.
### User Defined Type
- These are data types that the user can define themselves. The user creates type with a decleration. In addition to basic data types, it can be defined with struct, union, class.
### Internal Linkage
- The state of element (variable, function class) being visible only within certain source file. So, this element can only be accessed by elements in the same source file.
